Scripts for installing Python and Java on Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04

Introduction

This is project accomplishes the task of provisioning two Amazon EC2 
instances with the following specifications:

Windows 8, with the following software installed with Python version 2.7.9
and Java version 1.8 installed.

Ubuntu 14.04, with the following software installed with Python version 2.7.9
and Java version 1.8 installed.


Platform-specific notes
Can be ran within Windows, Mac or Linux systems running Python and 
Boto package for Python. Boto can be found at https://github.com/boto/boto 

Internet accessibility.

Getting Started - How to use
Simply call the Python script within the launch package. The launch package 
entails these three files: awspythjava.py, user_data_script.ps1, and 
user_data_script.sh .

The format for calling this script:
$python awspythjava.py -k <ec2-Key> -o <Operating System>

ec2-Key: user defined
Operating System: 	This will define the OS you need provisioned on the AWS 
					instance.
					Values:- windows/ubuntu 

e.g $python awspythjava.py -k ec2-autogen0430-key -o ubuntu

Work flow:
1. Script called
2. Based on the OS being provisioned, the required instance is triggered on AWS
3. The user_data scripts will be called once the instance is fully up. The 
   required Windows or Ubuntu script will be also called base of the parameters
   passed. Windows script(user_data_script.ps1) / Ubuntu script (user_data_script.sh)


Possible upgrades
- Determine the system being launched from and selecting the desired python commands
  sets to use. Will accomplish with check system function call and a few if else
  statements.

- Complete Windows user_data_scprit.ps1. Will eb a duplicate of the Ubuntu's' script
  user_data_script.sh but with Windows Powershell scripting commands.

- Include AWS EC2 Windows 8 instance option. I did manage to test successfully on my local
  Windows 8 machine.
  
- To auto install and configure Puppet on each instance
